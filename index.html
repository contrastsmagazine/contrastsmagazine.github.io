                <h2 id="theme">About Our Theme (&ldquo;Portals&rdquo;)</h2>
                <p>For our inaugural issue, we invite submissions that think with related to “portals.” From space- and time-bending teleportation devices to online hubs to hinged, wooden doors at the entrance of a home, portals index the fantastical and mundane passageways that separate our access to and movement between worlds. —gates, doors, and openings through which we enter into other worlds. TheyPortals often mark the betwixt-and-between state of metamorphosis, liminal thresholds ripe with risks and possibilities.  [another sentence about portals re: science and technology?] For this issue, wWe invite submissions that consider “pPortals” expansively and creativelybroadly, drawing from perspectives in history, anthropology, literary studies, geography, media studies, and architecture, and other disciplines as they intersect with STS. Submissions may address facets of “pPortals” including, but not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Entrances and Exits:</em> If portals are entrywayspassageways into otheralternate worlds, timelines, and relationalities, what does it mean to open a portal—and to close it? How do discourses, representations, and architectures of openings (and closings) inspire and confine access to other possibilities for life and world-making?</li>
                </ul>
                <h2 id="submissions">Submissions</h2>
                <p>All features should be geared toward a broad, public audience. We invite submissions of pitches for three types of nonfiction feature related to the theme:</p>

                    <li><em>Long-form pieces</em> (preferably 3000–4000 words or equivalent), in any genre or form that speaks well to an online audience (e.g. creative nonfiction, visual essays, short films, interviews);</li>
                    <li><em>&ldquo;Broadcasts&rdquo;</em> — bite-size, very-short-form pieces (under 300 words);</li>
                    <li><em>&ldquo;From the Source&rdquo;</em> — showcase a primary source connected to the theme (e.g. an archival document, image, film, textexcerpt from a longer work), alongside a brief contextualizing introduction (100–200 words). Please include additional suggestions (50–100 words) for how it might be incorporated into classrooms (assignments, paired readings, etc).
